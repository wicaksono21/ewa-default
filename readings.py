Study skills or academic literacy?
A second key question concerning the nature of EAP is closely related to the first.
Extending the idea of specificity, it focuses on what diverse disciplinary expectations
mean in practice for teachers and students. The question is whether we regard EAP
as essentially skills-based, text-based or practice-based and, as a result, ask what
EAP actually is. In other words, it touches on how we should understand EAP’s role
in the academy, on its status as an academic subject, on its relation to the disciplines
and on the assumptions which underlie instruction. This unit surveys these three
main perspectives through the changes which have led to their emergence.
EAP AND CHANGING CONTEXTS
These three conceptions, of study skills, socialization and academic literacy, have
developed in succession, with later views incorporating earlier ones (Lea and Street,
2000). This represents a movement towards a more context-sensitive perspective,
reflecting changes in both higher education and our understandings of academic
communication. In particular, conceptions of EAP have changed because:
■ We have gradually learned more about the different teaching contexts in which
students find themselves and about the particular communicative demands
placed on them by their studies. In the early days, EAP was largely a materials
and teaching-led movement focusing on texts (e.g. Candlin et al., 1975) and
responding to the growing number of L2 students beginning to appear in
university courses. Since then a developing research base has emphasized the
rich diversity of texts, contexts and practices in which students operate in
the modern university.
■ There are growing numbers of students from ‘non-traditional’ backgrounds
entering university. These students, from social groups traditionally excluded
from higher education such as working-class, mature, ethnic minority and
international students, mean that there is now a more culturally, socially and
linguistically diverse student population in universities in many countries. In
the UK, for instance, only 2 per cent of the population went to university in the
1950s compared with more than a third of the eligible age group today (HEFCE,
1999). While disparities in the participation of certain social groups continue,
with individuals from working-class families still massively underrepresented,
16and with provision stratified in terms of resources and status, it is nevertheless
the case that undergraduate classes are no longer dominated by white middleclass monolingual school leavers in full-time enrolment. One result is that
teachers can no longer assume that students’ previous learning experiences
will provide appropriate schemata and skills to meet course demands, while
students themselves bring different identities, understandings and habits of
meaning-making to their learning.
■ Students now take a broader and more heterogeneous mix of academic subjects.
In addition to single-subject or joint honours degrees we now find complex
modular degrees and emergent ‘practice-based’ courses such as nursing, management and teaching. These new course configurations are more discoursally
challenging for students who have to move between genres, departments and
disciplines.
The diverse learning needs of such students are therefore focused in the challenges
to communicative competence presented by disciplinary-specific study, by new
modes of distance and electronic teaching and learning, and by changing circumstances both within the academy and in society at large. Diversity therefore takes
on a particular importance at the same time as employers demand work-ready
graduates equipped with the technical and interpersonal communication skills to
cope in the modern workplace. In sum, many of the old certainties about teaching
and learning in higher education are slowly being undermined. This has not only
given EAP greater prominence and importance in the academy, but also forced us
to evolve and to ask new questions. Instead of focusing on why learners have
difficulties in accessing the discourses of the academy, EAP now addresses the
influence of culture and the demands of multiple literacies on students’ academic
experiences. The responses of EAP to these challenges are discussed below.
Task A2.1
➤ What might be the main consequences for EAP teachers of these evolving
patterns of participation in higher education? What tensions might surround
this expansion for students themselves?
A STUDY SKILLS APPROACH TO EAP
Study skills can be understood narrowly as the more mechanical aspects of study
such as referencing, using libraries, dissertation formatting, etc. (Robinson, 1991),
but they are generally seen more broadly. Richards et al. (1992: 359), for instance,
give the following definition:
Abilities, techniques and strategies which are used when reading, writing,
or listening for study purposes. For example, study skills needed by
university students studying from English language textbooks include:
S t u d y s k i l l s o r a c a d e m i c l i t e r a c y ?

★adjusting reading speeds according to the type of material being read, using
the dictionary, guessing word meanings from context, interpreting graphs,
diagrams, and symbols, note taking and summarising.
The basis of the approach is that students need more than linguistic knowledge
to be successful in their studies. Interest in study skills, in fact, emerged from a
perceived over-emphasis on linguistic forms in early register-based materials.
Registers refer to broad areas of activity such as communication in technical,
scientific and legal fields, and early ESP materials writers, such as Herbert (1965)
and Ewer and Latorre (1969), followed this approach by analysing corpora of
specialist texts to establish the statistical patterns of different registers. Halliday
et al. (1964: 88, 190) set out this programme in one of the earliest discussions
of ESP:
Registers . . . differ primarily in form . . . the crucial criteria of any given
register are to be found in its grammar and lexis. . . . Every one of these
specialized needs requires, before it can be met by appropriate teaching
materials, detailed studies of restricted languages or special registers carried
out on the basis of large samples of language used by the particular persons
concerned.
When translated into the classroom this view can be seen as an early form of generic
skills, but the reaction against register analysis in the 1970s moved interest away
from the lexical and grammatical properties of register to the communicative tasks
students had to engage in. Driven by work in education, an understanding of
learning moved to examining the learners’ experiences and to the actual context
and situation that they learn in (e.g. Entwistle and Ramsden, 1983).
The main idea of the study skills approach is that there are common reasoning
and interpreting processes underlying communication which help us to understand discourse. Rather than focusing on linguistic form, it is seen as being more
productive to focus on interpretative strategies and other competences. These skills
were mainly taught using general ‘carrier content’ which provides an academic
topic to contextualize the language skills to be learnt. For example, the life cycle of
plants might be used to teach biology students the language of process (Bates and
Dudley-Evans, 1976).
Emerging together with a growing interest in needs analysis, the skills approach
identified priorities from among the four main language skills for a particular
situation. As the definition above indicates, these often involved reading, but
analyses such as Munby’s (1978) taxonomy suggested a wider range of skills and
paved the way for more streamlined, and more empirically grounded, understandings of the competences students might need in order to engage in target
behaviours (Hyland, 2003).
In particular, this auditing of skills helped clarify the relationship between teaching
and target behaviours as well as itemizing the skills contributing to those behaviours,
18
I n t r o d u c t i o n
A
SECTIONsuch as how library searches, note taking, lecture comprehension, etc., could be
integrated to assist learners with their writing skills. Focusing on skills also highlighted the fact that students could benefit from training in learning strategies such
as organizing their study time, setting study goals, memorization, exam strategies,
and other study techniques. Detaching EAP from purely language issues in this way
therefore meant that EAP became relevant to native English-speaking students
as well as second-language learners, as many new undergraduates were unfamiliar
with the requirements of the tasks they faced in this new learning context. By the
late 1980s study skills was perhaps the dominant EAP approach (Jordan, 1989: 151).
One consequence of the study skills approach was a movement away from an
exclusive concern with descriptions of language use towards an interest in language
learning, a movement which reached its extreme with Hutchison and Waters’s (1987)
rejection of a specific academic register at all and the apparent abandonment
of EAP as a distinct field of education. Despite Hutchison and Waters’s attempts
to emphasize the processes of learning over the distinctive nature of what was to be
learnt, it became increasingly clear that the diversity of target tasks and genres which
learners were forced to confront was not easily approached exclusively through a
learner-centred model. Equally important, as our understanding of those target
tasks and genres developed it grew increasingly obvious that they were rather more
complex than first thought. Teachers came to see that many communicative
activities are specific to particular disciplines, and drew the conclusion that the
best way to prepare students for their learning was to provide them with an understanding of the assignments they would encounter in their academic classes, leading
to an approach geared more to target genres.
Task A2.2
➤ According to Dudley-Evans and St John (1998: 95) the term ‘skills’ is used at
two levels: five macro-skills: speaking (monologue), listening (monologue),
interacting, reading and writing, each consisting of several micro-skills such
as ‘using cohesive markers’ and ‘revising a first draft’. How far do you agree with
this? Does it adequately represent the main skills that EAP students must engage
in? Select one skill and identify the micro-skills for it.
DISCIPLINARY SOCIALIZATION
A simple study skills model therefore gave way to a more discipline-sensitive and
discourse-based approach which saw learning as an induction or acculturation into
a new culture rather than an extension of existing skills. The language competences
required by the disciplines may grow out of those which students practise in school,
but require students to understand the ways language forms and strategies work
to construct and represent knowledge in particular fields. A growing body of
research into knowledge creation, teaching and learning began to link literacy with
S t u d y s k i l l s o r a c a d e m i c l i t e r a c y ?
19
A
SECTION
★a more general understanding of the disciplines (e.g. Hyland, 2000; Swales, 1998).
We began to see that the experiences of students, like those of academics themselves,
involved interactions with others within the particular social and institutional
contexts in which they studied. Like academics, learners are not independent
of either each other or their contexts. As Text B1.2 suggests, attention turned to the
different kinds of writing that students are asked to do and to their orientation
to the particular tasks, interactions and discourses of their fields of study.
This approach draws attention to the homogeneity of disciplinary groups and
practices. Each discipline might be seen as an academic tribe (Becher, 1989) with
its particular norms and ways of doing things which comprise separate cultures.
Within each culture students acquire specialized discourse competences that allow
them to participate as group members. Wells (1992: 290) puts this succinctly:
Each subject discipline constitutes a way of making sense of human experience that has evolved over generations and each is dependent on its own
particular practices: its instrumental procedures, its criteria for judging
relevance and validity, and its conventions of acceptable forms of argument.
In a word each has developed its own modes of discourse. To work in a
discipline, therefore, it is necessary to be able to engage in these practices
and, in particular, to participate in the discourses of that community.
Unlike the study skills approach, then, disciplinary socialization implies an integrated view which links language, user and context. What counts as legitimate
knowledge is constructed through specific teaching and learning practices in diverse
disciplines. We can see, then, that this is not simply a minor shift of perspective
but a basic reappraisal of EAP and its role in the academy. It suggests an important
new sphere of activity which is much broader than skills teaching: it locates EAP at
the heart of university teaching and learning and of students’ orientation to, and
success in, their fields of study.
This perspective also draws attention to the importance of discourse and its role
in defining disciplinary groups. The term ‘discourse’ is widely used in the social
sciences and in a variety of ways. It is often employed in a general sense to refer to
different ways of representing aspects of the world, evoking the ways of thinking
and talking that recur across different speakers/writers and texts. Here discourses
help to scaffold the activities of social groups and their affiliations so we talk
of scientific discourse or political discourse. More specifically it refers to a stretch of
language, or text, that has been put to use as communication – it is language in use.
These two uses are related: by engaging in certain discourses we participate in and
build our communities and disciplines.
The concept of community will be discussed in more detail in Unit A2.5, but it is
worth pointing out here that the EAP literature tends to see academic discourse
communities as hierarchical with members of different rank and prestige. An
important distinction is made between experts and novices in this pecking order,
with newcomers socialized into the practices of members (Lave and Wenger, 1991;
20
I n t r o d u c t i o n
A
SECTIONWertsch et al., 1995). While undergraduates are seen as peripheral, and perhaps
only temporary, members of a disciplinary community, they must nevertheless
adopt the discourse practices of their professors to be accepted. To a large extent,
their academic accomplishments are seen to depend on the success of this induction, shown by their ability to reproduce particular discourse forms. The emphasis
here is therefore on a gradually mentored pathway to membership, or ‘cognitive
apprenticeship’, to full induction marked by control of the genres valued by their
communities.
The metaphor of apprenticeship, however, is not an entirely happy one, as it suggests
a clear route to a well defined goal, achieving membership, which confers privileges
and responsibilities (Gollin, 1998). Apprenticeship to a discipline is more vague
and ill defined than apprenticeship to a trade, and lacks the same kind of implied
mutual agreement between participants, with tutors willing to provide coaching
and structured support and students accepting a passive and recipient role.
Belcher (1994), however, points out that this was not the case in a study of three
postgraduate students and Candlin and Plum (1999) found little evidence from
student focus groups that undergraduates in psychology perceived their experience
in this way. Introduction to the cultural world of a discipline may well take place
in a situated learning context, but this is normally restricted to circumscribed
pedagogic tasks, particularly writing assignments.
ACADEMIC LITERACIES
While study skills and socialization approaches have largely sought to respond to
changes in tertiary education by supporting students in learning the unfamiliar
demands of new kinds of discourse, the third approach, that of academic literacies,
addresses some of the consequences of doing so. It does this by raising issues
of relevance and legitimacy in relation to writing practices in the disciplines. Like
the socialization approach, this perspective frames language as discourse practices,
the ways language is used in particular contexts, rather than as a set of discrete
skills. In other words it links language with action and emphasizes context. But
unlike the socialization model, it sees one of the most important dimensions of
these contexts as the participants’ experiences of them, and, more critically, of the
unequal power relations which help structure them.
This perspective takes a ‘new literacies’ position which rejects:
the ways language is treated as though it were a thing, distanced from both
teacher and learner and imposing on them external rules and requirements
as though they were but passive recipients.
(Street, 1995: 114)
Instead, literacy is something we do. Street characterizes literacy as a verb and Barton
and Hamilton (1998: 3) see it as an activity ‘located in the interactions between
S t u d y s k i l l s o r a c a d e m i c l i t e r a c y ?
21
A
SECTIONpeople’. Because literacy is integral to its contexts, it is easier to recognize the
disciplinary heterogeneity which characterizes the modern university. From the
student point of view a dominant feature of academic literacy practices is therefore the requirement to switch practices between one setting and another, to control
a range of genres appropriate to each setting, and to handle the meanings and
identities that each evokes.
Candlin and Plum (1999), for instance, show how students of business studies may
be expected to confront texts from accountancy, economics, financial management,
corporate organization, marketing, statistics, and so on, each giving rise to a surfeit
of different text types. As an illustration, Baynham (2000: 17) asks us to think of:
The harassed first-year nursing student, hurrying from lecture to tutorial,
backpack full of photocopied journal articles, notes and guidelines for an
essay on the sociology of nursing, a clinical report, a case study, a reflective
journal.
Such experiences underline for students that writing and reading are not homogeneous and transferable skills which students can take with them as they move
across different courses and assignments.
An academic literacies approach emphasizes that the ways we use language, referred
to as ‘literacy practices’, are patterned by social institutions and power relationships.
This means that some literacies, such as those concerned with legal, scientific
and political domains, for example, become more dominant and important than
others. The complexity and prestige of certain professional academic literacies
work to exclude many individuals, preventing their access to academic success
or membership of academic communities. For those entering the academy it forces
them to make a ‘cultural shift’ in order to take on alien identities as members of
those communities. Gee (1990: 155) stresses the importance of this shift:
someone cannot engage in a discourse in a less than fluent manner. You are
either in it or you’re not. Discourses are connected with displays of identity
– failing to display an identity fully is tantamount to announcing you do
not have that identity – at best you are a pretender or a beginner.
Academic success means representing yourself in a way valued by your discipline,
adopting the values, beliefs and identities which academic discourses embody. As a
result, students often feel uncomfortable with the ‘me’ they portray in their academic
writing, finding a conflict between the identities required to write successfully and
those they bring with them.
This approach therefore builds on the socialization perspective to take a more
critical view of the extent to which we can see disciplines as uncontested, homogeneous institutional practices and power as equally distributed. While the academic
literacy approach lacks a clear and distinctive pedagogy, it offers a more elaborate
22
I n t r o d u c t i o n
A
SECTIONand nuanced view of context to explain students’ experiences. Drawing on Halliday’s
(1994) concept of context, it argues that we need to understand the context of
situation, or the immediate situation in which learning and language use occur,
together with the context of culture, a broader and more abstract notion. This
concerns the ways language used in particular circumstances is influenced by
the social structures, the institutional and disciplinary ideologies and the social
expectations which surround those immediate circumstances. These issues will be
taken up in relation to academic activity in Unit A1.4.
Finally, we can see that while each of these three perspectives on EAP addresses
students’ immediate needs and experiences in the academy, none explicitly refers
to the post-university world of work. For most students university is a temporary
experience of acquiring knowledge, more or less firmly bracketed off from other
domains of life and the more urgent workplace priorities of earning a living
and building a career. In those contexts activities are focused less on the individual
than on the transactions and collaborations of working in teams and groups, and
for second-language speakers often with less engagement with native Englishspeaker interlocutors and texts. One major difference between instruction for
academic and workplace contexts is that there is less consensus on the skills,
language and communicative behaviours required in this world (St John, 1996).
It is also possible that text expectations may be linked not only with the values
and conventions of particular discourse communities but with either national or
corporate contexts (e.g. Garcez, 1993), so that communication strategies, status
relationships and cultural differences are likely to impact far more on successful
interaction (Thralls and Blyler, 1993; Pogner, 1999). These are among the key issues
which are emerging as important challenges for EAP professionals.
Task A2.3
➤ What is your view? Is EAP primarily a straightforward exercise in teaching
study skills, a means of socializing students into fields of study, or a way of
helping students navigate their ways through conflicting issues of power and
identity? Reflect on your response to this question and consider the reasons for
making this choice. How might each view influence how EAP teachers carry
out their role?
"""
READING2 = """Unit A4
Pragmatism or critique?
The final issue in this theme is also central to the nature of EAP, influencing
how we understand and practise it. It follows closely from the themes discussed
above, particularly in Unit A2 and the issue of whether EAP should be concerned
with skills, disciplinary socialization or literacy practices. Here we are concerned
with the ethics of EAP and the charge that in helping learners to develop their
academic communicative competence we reinforce conformity to an unexamined
educational and social order. This, then, is the issue of whether EAP is a pragmatic
exercise, working to help students to fit unquestioningly into subordinate roles in
their disciplines and courses, or whether it has a responsibility to help students
understand the power relations of those contexts.
Task A4.1
➤ What is your view? Is the role of EAP to help students to ‘fit into roles in their
disciplines and courses or to help students understand the power relations
of those contexts’? What arguments might you use to persuade someone of each
position?
EAP AS A PRAGMATIC ENTERPRISE
The notion of pragmatism can be defined in a number of ways, but in EAP it can
be interpreted as meaning teaching which is ‘sensitive to contexts of discourse and
of action’ (Allison, 1996: 87). As we have noted earlier, this has typically been seen
as one of the core principles of EAP: providing targeted instruction for students
which takes full account of the possibilities and constraints of local academic
demands. It urges teachers to investigate contexts and learners to make decisions
about what to include in their syllabus, what readings and tasks to set and how
to deliver their classes. A pragmatic orientation to teaching ensures that action is
informed by understanding (Widdowson, 1990), so that curricular decisions are
underpinned by a sensitivity to the contexts of teaching and to the most urgent
needs of learners. This, then, forms the basis of the considerable effort and commitment on the part of EAP teachers to establish students’ needs, negotiate suitable
goals with subject specialists and resource-conscious administrators, assemble
appropriate materials and devise learning tasks.
30
★One of the main objectives of this approach is, therefore, to empower learners by
initiating them into the ways of making meanings that are valued in their target
courses and disciplines, to ‘help people, both native and non-native speakers, to
develop their academic communicative competence’ (Swales, 1990: 9). Learners
commonly lack knowledge of the genres that possess ‘cultural capital’ in the
academy, and EAP teachers are committed to more equal distribution of this
knowledge to assist learners towards academic and professional success. Students
and academics alike are judged by their control of the discourses of their disciplines:
it is these valued discourses which determine educational life chances, regulate entry
into professions, restrict passage through career pathways and have symbolic value
in institutions. In other words, mastery of important disciplinary genres signifies
the competence of their users in relation to their fields.
EAP teachers recognize that there are dangers in this approach. Prestigious genres
are often associated with precedent and proper procedure and this means that
they represent an elite of expertise and power. So by ‘helping students to develop
their academic communicative competence’ teachers may be simultaneously stifling
students’ creativity and sacrificing their academic identities to the genres and discourses authorized by the academy. But while academic study privileges certain ways
of making meanings and marginalizes others, this is a large part of what disciplinary
engagement and participation in the work of an academic community actually
mean. Ideas are negotiated within discoursal constraints which help define the
boundaries of disciplines and establish valid contributions and argument.
We can also argue, however, that an understanding of the genres of the powerful not
only provides access to those genres, and so redistributes valued literacy resources,
but also allows users to see how they represent the interests of the powerful (Christie,
1987; Hyland, 2004). A pragmatic stance does not, therefore, exclude criticism
or imply conformity (Allison, 1996). A pragmatic pedagogy has the potential for
helping students to reflect on and critique the ways in which knowledge and information are organized and constructed in their disciplines. Wider understandings
of influence and interests in the academy are developed not only by openly challenging existing structures but by studying texts in a comparative and questioning
way which explores the relationship between disciplinary practices, institutional
contexts and rhetorical preferences.
Task A4.2
➤ Ivanic (1998: 337–8) argues that the most effective teaching encourages students
to be:
active participants in social struggles, not just passively receiving knowledge
and advice, but searching for understandings which will be of direct use to
them, which will open up new fields of vision and new perspectives, and
provide a basis for their own emancipatory and transformatory action.

★Is it the role of EAP instruction to lead students in this direction? How far are
you, as an EAP teacher, responsible for students to understand their learning
in this way?
CRITICAL EAP
In contrast to a ‘pragmatic view’, critical EAP engages students in the types of
activities they are asked to perform in academic classes while encouraging them
to question, and perhaps even reform, those activities and the conditions they are
based on. The emergence of various critical approaches to applied linguistics since
the early 1980s has led to increased interest in ideas such as ideology, identity,
subjectivity and power in the field of language teaching.
Of particular interest in EAP is the idea of critical language awareness, as this
aims to:
empower learners by providing them with a critical analytical framework to help them reflect on their own language experiences and practices
and on the language practices of others in the institutions of which they
are part and the wider society in which they live.
(Clark and Ivanic, 1997: 217)
Critical approaches thus share an orientation with the ‘academic literacies’ approach
to EAP by recognizing that there are various literacies, or sets of social communicative practices, in everyday life and emphasizing how access to institutionally valued
literacies has the power to enhance or reduce people’s life chances.
Critical theorists such as Benesch (2001) and Pennycook (1997, in Section B) argue
that there is a political quietism in the EAP literature. It is too ready to conflate the
needs of students with those of the disciplines and so uncritically ‘accommodate’
learners to the requirements of their courses. Pennycook (1997: 257), for example,
argues that the for connecting English with Academic Purposes suggests that language
is a neutral medium through which meanings pass, and that this instrumental
view of language obscures the cultural, social and ideological contexts of language.
He suggests that this constructs an ‘unproblematic relationship between English
and Academic Purposes’ which can lead practitioners to accept existing conditions
and to reproduce them in our classes. EAP thus constructs for itself a spurious
‘neutrality’ which encourages practitioners to see its goals and activities as inevitable
and natural.
A critical approach thus involves questioning these goals and practices, as Benesch
(2001: 41) observes:
My critique of EAP’s ideology of pragmatism is directed at its assumption
that students should accommodate themselves to the demands of academic
assignments, behaviours expected in academic classes, and hierarchical
32
I n t r o d u c t i o n
A
SECTIONarrangements within academic institutions. In addition, EAP’s pragmatism
assumes ESL faculty should subordinate their instruction to those demands,
behaviours, and arrangements, perpetuating a service relationship to
colleagues in other departments.
There are clearly two issues here: that of developing an inquiring and explanatory
approach to language-mediated content, and that of establishing a credible and
independent field of EAP. In some ways it might be more helpful to treat them
separately as a way of moving forward to explore the most effective and nuanced
ways of harnessing critical activity and creating an independent EAP.
One aspect of a critical approach is consideration of the wider context of culture in
which EAP operates: the institutional and social structures and ideologies which
intrude into local contexts of communication and the disciplinary cultures with
which both students and teachers engage. Fairclough (1992) sees discourse as the
link between the immediately local context of situation and the overarching
institutional context of culture, as it is here where ‘orders of discourse’, or approved
institutional practices such as assignments, seminars, essays, and so on, operate to
maintain existing relations of power and authority. The practices which operate
in education regulate what is worth knowing and who can know it, thus confirming
the status of those who have knowledge and the position to exercise it. So by providing students with socially authorized ways of communicating, critical theorists
argue that the genres we teach buttress disciplinary hierarchies and promote the
values of powerful social groups by reinforcing particular social roles and relationships between writers and readers. In Benesch’s words, it serves to ‘accommodate’
students to powerful interests.
Task A4.3
➤ Critical theorists raise several issues of direct relevance to EAP practice.
What do you think are the most important of these for your own context and
what kinds of tasks, topics and instructional approaches might best address
them?
EAP, GENRES AND CRITICAL PEDAGOGY
It is easy to polarize the critical and pragmatist perspectives, and EAP has certainly
been guilty of ignoring issues of power, but the situation is more fluid and nuanced
than this at local levels. Some of the criticisms of EAP practice seem far too broad
and sweeping, ignoring the fact that EAP is not a single monolithic ideology or
set of assumptions but a plurality of practices and possibilities in different contexts.
Many practitioners already take an inquiring attitude towards the activities of
the disciplines and content courses and encourage such questioning among their
students. Indeed, these issues are more often raised by teachers themselves than by
P r a g m a t i s m o r c r i t i q u e ?
33

★students, so that critical EAP runs the danger of presuming to speak for students
rather than assisting them to speak for themselves. We also need to consider the
real-world consequences and pay-offs for students and how critical action might
actually be harnessed to both bring about change and equip learners with a challenging and inquiring attitude to their studies and fields of practice. Clearly, such
broadly theoretical arguments continue to need classroom situated exploration.
Allison (1996), for instance, points to the struggles that teachers often face in their
institutions, and, despite their often vulnerable working conditions, many EAP
teachers try to engage with a variety of critical issues in helping learners to understand texts and disciplines and to improve the conditions of their learning. They
acknowledge that students often take a pragmatic view of their studies, yet at the
same time hear them complain about the apparently arbitrary conventions of
academic writing, of the vagueness of course assignments, of the obscurity of their
readings and of the lack of fit between their home and academic experiences.
Effective teachers therefore look at the implications of their work, attempting to
avoid the unexamined, socially reproductive practices of what Cherryholmes (1988)
calls ‘vulgar pragmatism’ in favour of a more reflective stance of ‘critical pragmatism’
which recognizes a variety of locally effective ways to help students demystify the
academic worlds in which they find themselves so that ‘critical’ becomes explanatory
and not only political.
Clearly critique requires understanding, and Johns (1997) suggests various ethnographic explorations that students can undertake to gain this understanding
by exploring their own courses and faculty practices. Students can, for example,
interview subject tutors on their reasons for selecting certain readings, textbooks,
assignment topics or assessment procedures, or they can ask lecturers about their
writing preferences, teaching practices, professional experiences and beliefs about
the discipline. In addition, it is often possible for students to participate in the
negotiation of classroom pedagogies to take greater control of their learning
experience (Breen and Littlejohn, 2000; Canagarajah, 2002) or for teachers to engage
learners in a critical dialogue about topics or teaching (Benesch, 2001). These issues
will be taken up in Unit A3.10 in discussing process syllabuses.
At postgraduate level, Cadman (2002) offers ways that EAP teachers can question
dominance in research education by opening discussions with supervisors, giving
greater responsibility to learners and establishing a co-operative EAP classroom.
These strategies rely on reconceptualizing the roles of teacher, learner and classroom
through a structured process of individual and group activities to gradually take up
management of their own learning. This is achieved by articulating and prioritizing
their personal situations and goals and by negotiating with EAP staff, their supervisors and their classmates for an appropriate curriculum, thereby foregrounding
and debating issues of power, authority and ownership of knowledge.
For others, providing learners with greater understanding of and access to valued
genres is a crucial aspect of this demystification – not least because it is students

SECTIONfrom non-English-speaking backgrounds who are among the most disadvantaged
by lack of such access. Learning about genres does not preclude critical analysis. In
fact it provides a necessary basis for critical engagement with cultural and textual
practices, as Hammond and Macken-Horarik (1999: 529) argue:
Systematic discussion of language choices in text construction and the
development of metalanguage – that is, of functional ways of talking
and thinking about language – facilitates critical analysis. It helps students
see written texts as constructs that can be discussed in quite precise and
explicit ways and that can therefore be analysed, compared, criticised,
deconstructed, and reconstructed.
Understanding how texts are socially constructed and ideologically shaped reveals
the ways they work to represent some interests and perspectives and neglect others.
By focusing on the literacy practices writers encounter at school, at work and
at university, EAP pedagogies help them to distinguish differences and provide
them with a means of understanding their educational experiences in relation to
their home experiences. It undermines a view of writing as a universal, naturalized
and non-contestable way of participating in communities so that what appear
as dominant and superior forms of writing can be seen as simply different practices,
thereby opening them to scrutiny and challenge. Providing learners with ways of
talking about language and how it works as communication in particular contexts
can therefore assist them with the means of both communicating effectively in
writing and of analysing texts critically.
It is clearly part of every teacher’s professional practice to consider these broader
issues and to recognize that their work has the potential to accommodate students
to the status quo. Teachers are responsible professionals, not simply technicians
applying procedures. They constantly search for ethical ways of responding to
increasingly difficult political and commercial pressures and reflect on the learning
experiences of their students and whether their instruction and assessment
procedures have been principled, effective and fair. They pursue wider curriculum
development in the contexts in which they work and contribute their expertise to
understand the social, conceptual and communicative demands that their students
face. They recognize that their students often have pragmatic goals yet encourage
them to greater critical awareness of the discourses they use. The greater challenge
is applying this in practice – reconstructing pedagogy to engage with and promote
this more critical stance. In other words, even though the educational and social
issues surrounding EAP classrooms are complex and often hostile to innovation
and critique, they can be places of awareness and change while meeting learning
and subject course objectives.

Introduction
‘Academic literacies’ is a relatively new empirical and theoretical field1 setting out to
explore reading and writing in academia as social practice, using ethnographically-oriented
methodologies and drawing on a range of critical theories. The pluralisation of ‘literacies’
signals an interest in academic reading and writing not only as diverse and situated in specific
disciplinary contexts, but also as ideologically shaped, reflecting institutional structures and
relations of power. This ideological concern gives rise to a transformative agenda
encompassing individual writers, the conventions and practices of the academy, and the wider
social relations in which all are embedded.
Academic literacies combines an empirical interest in the relationship between
linguistic/rhetorical conventions and knowledge making practices in academia as currently
configured, with a critically driven vision of how these could be different, (though this will
always be contested) more richly varied and more equitable. In many ways, Academic
Literacies remains on the margins of academic writing theory and pedagogy, but has
contributed dynamism to a number of research domains concerned with academic writing,
including EAP.
This chapter aims to provide a broad overview of the field, pointing to key empirical and
theoretical landmarks. The chapter also focuses specifically on the interface between
Academic Literacies and EAP, in keeping with the particular concerns of this volume. A key
aim is to explore connections and divergences with particular traditions within EAP, and in
particular to articulate some of the fruitful connections between Academic Literacies
(henceforward ‘Ac Lits’) and work in the domain known as ‘Critical EAP’.
We begin by offering a historical account of the emergence and development of this field,
followed by a consideration of some of the key themes raised by scholars in foundational, as
1 The term’s origin as a descriptor for the field derives in part from the use of “literacies” to denote a social
practice perspective in New Literacy Studies, but it was in circulation from the late 1980s onwards in a range of
contexts. For discussion see Lillis and Scott 2007.well as in more recent, contributions. We then briefly review a key area of current debate: the
relationship of Ac Lits-informed “critique” to practice. The following section focuses on
research methodology in Ac Lits, outlining its overarching ethnographic orientation. The
final two sections explicitly focus on key divergences and connections between Ac Lits and
work within EAP, pointing to the generative questions raised by both. We conclude by
calling for greater dialogue between Ac Lits and critical EAP in order to develop rich
understandings of what it means to do academic knowledge making in the contemporary
world.
Historical perspectives
Academic literacies emerged in the 1990s in the UK and in South Africa, in national contexts
where the higher education systems were undergoing profound change. In the UK, the policy
context was one of higher education expansion, ‘Widening Participation’2 and increasing
diversity of the student population.
The initial concern was not primarily international students or multilingualism, a key focus of
attention in EAP, but ‘local’ students (whether monolingual or multilingual) whose
increasing presence in higher education threw into relief taken-for-granted academic literacy
practices and problematized the idea that academic literacy in a particular language (assumed
to be English) was relatively straightforward to teach and learn and, once learned, was
transferable from one context to another (Ivanič and Lea, 2006; Lea and Street, 1998; Lillis,
2001, 2014).
In South Africa, interest in the writing and reading practised at university emerged in the
national context of post-Apartheid expansion of higher education where concerns with
access, diversity, power and equality were central to a political agenda of social
transformation (Angelil Carter, 1998; Thesen and Cooper, 2014; Thesen and Pletzen, 2006).
In both these national contexts, researchers began to focus on academic writing, principally
because of the high stakes of writing for assessment, but also as a response to deficit
discourses in wide circulation (in national media, as well as educational circles) which
focused on students’ ‘inability’ to write (in English) (for discussions of ‘deficit’, see for
2 Widening Participation is the umbrella term used for a raft of ‘progressive’ policies set in motion in the 1990s
in the UK, increasing the undergraduate population and opening up university admissions for students from
underrepresented social groups.example Lea, 1994; Lillis and Turner, 2001; Thesen and van Plezen, 2006). Ac Lits research
was driven to a large extent by the concerns of practitioners - those with a role in teaching,
learning and language development in higher education – who recognised the inadequacy of
such deficit approaches. It was also becoming clear that ‘default’ teaching and learning
practices (such as lecture-monologues or the ubiquitous essay) were no longer fit for purpose
in relation to a diverse student body whose acculturation into academic literacies could not be
assumed on entry to university, and that ‘business as usual’ would in any case be
ideologically unacceptable in an expanded HE sector premised upon openness and diversity
as explicit political goals (for overviews of these debates see Lillis, 2001; Mann, 2008).
A key strand of this questioning of familiar HE pedagogies was a challenge to individualised,
psychologised approaches to learning and to normative assumptions about academic writing,
both of which, it was argued, fostered unhelpful deficit perceptions of students and - of
particular concern to academic literacies researchers - their language and literacy practices
(Haggis, 2003; Lea and Street, 1998), echoing arguments made by adult educators (e.g.
Gardener, 1992). Drawing on anthropologically-based New Literacy Studies (NLS) (Barton
et al, 2000; Baynham and Prinsloo, 2001; Gee, 1996), Ac Lits researchers reframed the
student writing ‘problem’ , turning the gaze on academic institutions (universities,
disciplines) focalised through the experiences and perspectives of student writers (Ivanič,
1998; Lea, 1994; Lea and Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001).
Street’s (1984) notion of ‘autonomous’ versus ‘ideological’ models of literacy was (and is)
key to the Ac Lits conceptual apparatus. Autonomous framings of literacy conceptualise it as
separate/separable from context, as a fixed set of skills or competencies which can be
possessed – or lacked – leading to destructive binary perceptions of learners as
literate/illiterate and to remedial, bolt-on writing pedagogies. Street, Lea and others
recognised that the “essayist literacy” which dominated (and still dominates) the academy
was just such an autonomous model (see Lillis 2001, Lillis and Turner, 2001). The
theorisation of reading and writing in the academy as no less contingent and contested than
any other set of literacy practices, in spite of ideological denial, led to the development of Lea
and Street’s (1998) now widely disseminated three-part heuristic or ‘three models’ of
academic writing, framed as:
(1)) decontextualized skills(2) more or less implicit academic socialisation into given genres and practices
(3)) situated, shifting and contested literacies.
An important aspect of this tripartite model (not always taken up in subsequent debates) is
that each tier “successively encapsulates the other” (Lea and Street, 1998: 158-9). In research
terms, this means that attention to academic writing as literacies does not exclude questions
generated by the other two conceptual levels but seeks a “more encompassing understanding
of the nature of student writing within institutional practices, power relations and identities”
(ibid.: 158-9). At around the same time as Lea and Street’s work, Ivanič (1998) was using
NLS-derived methodologies to generate insights into students’ experiences of academic
writing, particularly in relation to issues of identity. Ivanič’s 1998 study combined textual
analysis drawing on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (e.g. Fairclough, 1995) with insider
accounts of text production, demonstrating how ethnographic data could enrich
understandings of what it means to ‘do’ academic writing.
Viewing academic writing through a social practice/student writer lens exposed a damaging
gap in understanding between tutors and students (Ivanič 1998, Lea and Street 1998, Lillis
2001) and threw light on students’ struggles as they tried to negotiate a pathway through the
maze of tacit and sometimes contradictory expectations.. The use of CDA enabled a critical
analysis of institutional language; for example, Lea and Street discussing the language of
feedback, noted tutors’ use of “categorical modality, using imperatives and assertions, with
little mitigation or qualification”. They argue that such feedback comments enact tutors’
“right to criticise”, and as such are a marker of their power and authority over students (1998:
169). This aspect of the work made an important contribution to scholarship in the field of
HE assessment and feedback (see also Ivanič et al, 2000). Links were also made with the
much longer tradition of writing pedagogy/research in the United States, including
Composition Studies (e.g. in Ivanič 1998), which had begun to tackle questions of academic
literacy and higher education access several decades earlier. By drawing on these different
traditions – pedagogical, anthropological, and critical linguistic - Ac Lits researchers were
able to explore the rewards, risks and losses for academic writers, not only in terms of
academic success but also of meaning and identity (e.g. Angelil-Carter, 1998; Lillis, 2001).
Insights derived from ethnographic studies were sharpened through a parallel emerging
interest in the epistemological complexity of academic discourse, and through work
subjecting dominant academic rhetorical traditions to critical scrutiny (Candlin and Hyland,1999; Jones, Turner and Street, 1999), again influenced in part by work in the US-based
fields of Writing in the Disciplines (e.g. Bazerman, 1988) and Writing Across the Curriculum
(e.g. Russell, 1991).
Key themes in academic literacies research
A number of overlapping themes emerged from Ac Lits research activity which have
continued to be developed:
Students often experience the demands placed on them as writers as opaque and obscure.
This critique is captured by Lillis’ concept of “the institutional practice of mystery” (2001:
58) (a notion found useful by some EAP researchers and practitioners e.g. Harwood and
Hadley, 2004) developed in the context of her longitudinal ethnographic study of ten
undergraduate writers from ‘non-traditional’ backgrounds. Ac Lits research provides an
empirical basis for recasting difficulties in academic writing as an institutional issue rather
than one of individual failure and has included work on trainee HE teachers (Stierer, 2008),
undergraduates at prestigious institutions (Boz, 2009), and of academics themselves
(Gourlay, 2011; Lea and Stierer, 2011; Lillis and Curry, 2010). Ac lits work has been taken
up more widely in critical approaches to higher education pedagogy e.g. Haggis (2003),
Mann (2008).
Disciplinary discourses are historically situated and contested(able). The challenges for
students studying within more than one discipline are well documented by Lea and Street
(1998, 1999) showing that demands vary within the discipline, even from one tutor to
another, a finding supported in other studies (Baynham, 2000; Ivanič, 1998, Read et al.,
2001). Other research throws light on new ‘hybrid’ academic writing genres, associated in
particular with vocational degree courses, and the confusion (amongst students and tutors)
which often surrounds discourses and genres (Baynham 2000; Creme, 2000; Lea, 2012; Lillis
and Rai, 2011; Stierer, 2008). These empirical findings challenge unitary notions of academic
writing, exploding the myths of ‘transferability’ – that writing is a discrete, portable package
of competencies - and of ‘transience’- that the student writing ‘problem’ is caused by a
temporary influx of ‘underprepared’ or ‘disadvantaged’ students, and can be bracketed for
remedial action, until such students get up to speed, or things return to ‘normal’ (Thesen and
van Pletzen, 2006).Identity is a significant dimension in academic writing. Work by Ivanič (1998), Lea (1998),
Lillis (2001,) and Thesen (2001) among others, highlights the identity-related consequences
for students and scholars who bring ‘other’ experiences and discourses – those less valued in
the academy as currently configured – with them to their studies. Drawing on critical and
post structuralist work on discourse and subjectivity, such work makes explicit the ways in
which language is closely bound up with not only possibilities for meaning making, but for
possibilities for ‘being’ in the world. These and later studies e.g. Boz (2009) see identity/ies
not only as a function of individual biography and circumstance, but as a political question
closely connected with the distribution of cultural capital and the differential value attributed
to different meaning-making resources, in terms of discourses, languages and language
varieties (e.g. Thesen and Cooper, 2014; Thesen and van Pletzen, 2006).
There is a need to open up the academy to a broader range of semiotic/linguistic practices as
valid ‘funds of knowledge’ (Moll et al., 1992). Despite the de facto diversity and hybridity of
academic discourse referred to above, Ac Lits researchers have argued that the entrenched
privileging of essayist literacy perpetuates inequalities in the academy, closing down
diversity in knowledge-making, working against policy goals of widening access. Some
studies throw light on the role of evaluation and assessment by gatekeepers in maintaining
these conventions and regulating access to particular academic ‘inner circles’ e.g. Lillis and
Curry (2010). Others focus on students’ out-of-college literacies as a basis for exploring ways
in which gaps between home and college literacies can be bridged through changed
institutional practices and pedagogies (Ivanič et al, 2009; Lea and Jones, 2010; Paxton,
2007). Ac Lits thus specifically addresses diversification of the kinds of semiotic resources
that could be used for academic meaning-making, exploring ways in which the academy can
open up to new genres and practices (e.g. Archer, 2006; Creme, 2000; Curry, 2007; English,
2011; Lillis, 2011;Thesen, 2001) as a means towards institutional equity but also towards the
enrichment of academic knowledge-making. The ‘internationalisation’ of the academy has
meant that academic literacies research has increasingly followed the South African example
in turning its attention to the importance of adopting multilingual approaches to academic
knowledge production, with some researchers focusing on more ‘advanced’ academic writers
such as research students, and scholars writing for publication (Lillis and Curry, 2010).
There is a need to analyse practices in contemporary academia and the professions more
generally. In keeping with its stance of openness to diversity and change, increasingly
researchers in Ac Lits have extended their research foci. One key logical extension has beenin terms of writers – broadening beyond a focus on “learners” to include everyday
professional literacy practices e.g. social workers (Lillis and Rai, 2011) and academics (Lea
and Stierer, 2011), as well as academics seeking publication (Lillis and Curry, 2010).
Another key extension has been the increasing attention paid by academic literacies-informed
researchers to new and proliferating text production practices in a digital age of academia
(Coleman, 2010; Goodfellow and Lea 2007, 2013; Lea and Jones, 2010; McKenna and
Macavinia, 2011) as part ofrethinking what is meant by writing and reading in contemporary
society (Lillis 2013)
An issue of ongoing concern: the relationship between “critique” and practice
The critical orientation of Ac Lits, as in the case of critical EAP (discussed below), has
caused questions to be raised about its usefulness for teachers working in ‘mainstream’
contexts (e.g. Wingate and Tribble, 2012). Ac Lits researchers have always acknowledged the
need for a multi-layered approach which incorporates attention to issues more closely aligned
with models 1 and 2 of Lea and Street’s heuristic (1998, see above), such as the need to raise
students’ awareness of valued academic genres and to support them to present ‘polished’
work which does not draw attention to itself through ‘errors’. The need to find ways of
drawing on academic literacies critique to build pedagogy is emphasised in Lillis (2003,
2011) ) where, drawing on Bakhtin, she proposes and illustrates a writing pedagogy aimed
dialogic rather than dialectic meaning making. . Lea (2004) and Paxton and Frith (2014)
focus on the implications of Ac Lits critique for curriculum design.
What Ac Lits seeks to explicitly avoid is the idea that students first need to learn ‘the basics’
and only then can be exposed to a pedagogy which leaves space for questioning and change.
Questioning – for students and teachers – can be seen as a distraction from getting down to
the real business of learning to master academic discourses, with the danger that questioning
is infinitely postponed – or reserved only for those already admitted to academic ‘inner
circles’ – and that the identities, knowledges and semiotic resources which student writers
bring from outside the academy are gradually left behind, to the detriment of all. Thus
criticality is key to any pragmatism centred on writers’ desires for meaning-making as well as
on academic success. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it may be easier to
implement dialogic and critical pedagogies in higher education spaces where the constraints
are not so huge, for example at postgraduate level or in particularly privileged institutional
contexts (Tuck, 2013). The question of what Ac Lits scholarship has to offer with regard todeveloping transformative practice is one taken seriously as illustrated in work by Lea 2004;
Lillis 2003, 2011; Street and Leung (2009) and Street
(http://teachingeap.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/blogpost-by-brian-street-academic-literacies).
A recent example of the explicit attempt to define and illustrate what it means to adopt or
‘work with’ Ac Lits for pedagogy or course design is the forthcoming Working with
Academic Literacies collection, where teacher-researchers provide case studies of pedagogic
interventions at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and across disciplinary contexts (Lillis
et al eds, forthcoming). Case studies from across disciplinary boundaries in ten different
countries illustrate how teacher-researchers are seeking to transform pedagogies of academic
writing and reading, to transform the kinds of resources, genres and semiotic practices that are
used/able in academia and to transform the ways in which institutions conceptualise what it means to
engage successfully in academic literacy practices and to develop provision which meets their policy
goals of inclusivity and diversity.
Main research methods
A social practice perspective entails a view of writing as inseparable from context, hence the
need for ethnographic methodologies which facilitate analysis of texts as part of contexts.
Thus, as well as analysing samples of academic writing, in draft and as ‘finished’ products,
Ac lits researchers may, for example:
 elicit writer views, and/or literacy histories, often through interviews centred around
particular texts
 gather textual, field note, photographic and interview data which throw light on
institutional contexts and/or writers’ interests
 conduct participant observation of literacy events as a lens onto practice
One core generative tension of ethnography is the dynamic between insider (emic)
perspectives (usually of writers themselves) and the outsider (etic) perspective of the
researcher-analyst. The desire to move beyond text, to seek understandings of writing which
cannot be derived solely from the expert or etic analysis of text, was a key driver in the work
of some early researchers in the field who were conscious of the limitations of formal
linguistic analysis alone (Ivanič, 1998; Lillis, 2001).Given its concern with the production and evaluation of academic texts, Ac Lits research
necessarily incorporates an interest in texts as part of broader, open-ended data generation.
However, the ways in which texts are analysed in any given study varies considerably. An
indication of the range is provided by the work of Ivanič, whose study of eight student writers
involved extensive textual analysis, using CDA, SFL and frames from Goffman, alongside
other data such as interviews with students and tutors and institutional documentation (1998).
A later study, in contrast, focused primarily on tracing UK Further Education students’
vernacular literacy practices , employing a range of creative data gathering instruments, such
as annotated floor plans and photo-ethnographies (Mannion and Ivanič, 2007), but with
relatively little close attention to the characteristics of the texts students were producing in
college (but see Ivanič, 2006). Others have focused on the multimodal affordances and
constraints of vernacular and official forms of academic text making for knowledge
production (e.g. Thesen, 2001; Archer, 2006; English, 2011). Some studies have focused on
the dynamic processes of text production, using notions such as ‘text histories’ and ‘text
trajectories’ to track entextualisation and recontextualisation practices. In such studies (e.g.
Lillis and Curry, 2010) analytic attention is placed on identifying key features of academic
texts as well as tracking how and when such features come into being in the process of text
production.
It’s possible to see a continuum of research focus withinAc Litswhere the role of textual data
varies depending on the particular empirical focus and on researcher orientations and
backgrounds. The question of the role of text analysis within the overarching ethnographic
framework, and the relationship between texts and practices, is still a richly problematic and
contested one. Lillis (2008), drawing on linguistic ethnography (e.g. Rampton, 2007) has
argued for more context-sensitive categories for analysing texts, more consistent with an
ethnographic epistemology, for example using notions such as ‘indexicality’ and
‘orientation’.
Academic Literacies and EAP
This brief account of the key concerns of Ac Lits points to a number of shared motivations
with the field of EAP writ large but also to a number of differences. It’s important to consider
the similarities and differences, identifying in particular the intellectual space in which AcLits and a specific tradition within EAP, Critical EAP, converge. Needless to say, this is an
ongoing debate and what we offer is one perspective here.
Both fields have arisen out of practitioner-led concerns and an interest in bringing theory and
empirical research to bear to help students – and increasingly academics - to succeed as
writers and communicators in the increasingly globalised, English-dominant academy. They
share an interest in foregrounding the often tacit nature of academic conventions and in
making these visible; researchers in both fields have also emphasized the importance of
investigating academic literacy as a highly situated practice. EAP has been interested in
investigating the detailed discoursal requirements of different disciplines which is echoed in
the attention to academic literacy as social practice in Ac Lits work. As a corollary, in both
EAP and Ac Lits research, the ‘target’ or valued rhetorical practices of any particular context
have been the object of empirical enquiry, rather than assumed. Indeed, a shared overarching
goal in EAP (evidenced by chapters in this volume) and Ac Lits has been to foreground the
constitutive role of language in the academy, challenging its often marginal positioning in
academic work (Turner, 2011b).
Nevertheless, there are key differences between EAP and Ac Lits in the stances towards the
phenomena being explored:
 The key object or phenomenon under exploration in EAP tends to be the text whereas in Ac
Lits it tends to be the producer or meaning maker. In an attempt to make visible academic
conventions, there is a tendency in EAP to reify such conventions and in so doing construe
them as relatively fixed. Ac Lits sees such conventions as always contested/able.
 The explicit language of focus in EAP is ‘English’, with the target linguistic medium,
English, construed in a very specific way (albeit often implicitly): that is, as a stable
linguistic resource, as ‘standard (academic) English ’and as used by assumed ‘native’
speakers-. In contrast, in Ac Lits, the specific nature and status of ‘English’ has been
explicitly challenged, not least because the focus on ‘non-traditional’ students and their
desires for ‘vernacular’ English(es) necessarily problematizes common sense assumptions
about there being one kind of ‘native’ speaker or one kind of acceptable ‘native (academic)
English’. In EAP the overriding metaphor adopted to describe students’ participation has been that of
novice-expert trajectory. Whilst this metaphor is also used in Ac Lits, the emphasis tends to
be on the diversity of life experiences and knowledges brought by students into the
academywhich challenges any simple dichotomies between novice and expert.
 The ideological orientation towards pedagogy differs in emphasis in EAP and Ac Lits. EAP
research (whether in EAP or disciplinary specific spaces) usually operates from the
standpoint that once target conventions, genres and discourses are identified students can
and should be inducted into these. Flexibility is valued but primarily in terms of the students’
ability to manage existing conventions: thus students are encouraged to be agile adaptors,
“navigating” the expectations of different audiences (e.g. see Belcher, 2009). In Ac Lits, on
the other hand, shift and change are seen as inherent in academic discourse itself, and agility
and responsiveness the responsibility of academic communities and gatekeepers as well as of
students. The EAP orientation to pedagogy has been described as ‘normative’ (Lillis and
Scott, 2007), in contrast to the ‘transformative’ orientation in Ac Lits. What is meant by
transformative and how this connects with the orientation of a key strand of EAP, ‘critical
EAP’, is discussed below.
Of course, in pointing to differences here we are foregrounding what we see as ‘mainstream
EAP’, some aspects of which have been strongly challenged from within EAP itself, notably
‘critical EAP’ (e.g. Benesch, 2001; Turner, 2004, 2012). In the final section below we
summarise what we see as key convergences between Ac Lits and critical EAP.
Future directions: A converging space- critical EAP and Ac Lits
Rather than assume the two fields can straightforwardly be combined or their differences
collapsed (as in Wingate and Tribble, 2012), it’s important to be aware of where
convergences between EAP and Ac Lits lie. The key convergence is in ideological
orientation, signalled by the use of ‘critical’ in critical EAP and ‘literacies’ in Ac Lits. We
highlight what we see as key convergences and future directions for research into academic
literacy practices in academia.
Rethinking the producerAs Hyland points out (2014), critical EAP involves a shift from a rationalistic approach to
‘needs’ analysis’, towards a language pedagogy built on ‘rights’ analysis as set out by
Benesch:
Critical EAP allows ESL teachers and students to examine externally imposed
demands and negotiate their responses to them, by addressing the following questions:
Who formulated these requirements and why? Should they be fulfilled? Should they
be modified? What are the consequences of trying to change current conditions? What
is gained by obeying, and what is lost? (2001, p. 53)
This opening up of such questions is strongly echoed in Ac Lits work in ongoing debates
about how to involve producers in choices around academic meaning making.
Rethinking the linguistic and semiotic resources for academic meaning making
Challenges to monolingualist assumptions for academic meaning making have long been
voiced in Ac Lits and EAP work, particularly from multilingual contexts such as South
Africa, often engaging directly with work in the fields of Contrastive Rhetoric and Second
Language Writing (Angelil-Carter, 1998; ). Key questions being asked in critical EAP and Ac
Lits include the following: whose English(es) are/should be valued and why? Where and how
can/should vernacular language and literacy practices – including code meshing - be used in
academic knowledge making? To what extent can and should a broader range of linguistic
and modal resources be used in academic knowledge making? (English, 2011; Horner et al.,
2011; Lillis and Curry, 2010; Pennycook, 1997) Whilst there is some work teasing out these
questions, there is considerably more to be done.
Rethinking trajectories
Once the academic space is construed as contested in terms of whose voices and knowledges
can get to be heard, relying on a default metaphor of apprenticeship - from novice to expertbecomes questionable. Work focusing on both the student-writer (e.g. Angelil-Carter, 1998)
and professional academic writers (e.g. Canagarajah, 2002; Flowerdew and Li, 2009; Lillis
and Curry, 2010) problematizes any straightforward positioning of writers and readerevaluators within the academy as novices or experts, pointing instead to a diverse range of
expertise and trajectories. Work on the academic practices of scholars, rather than students, in
particular foregrounds the ways in which presumed trajectories (and therefore assumptionsabout the writer and reader) are mediated by stratification between the global centre and
peripheries (see Canagarajah, 2002; Lillis and Curry, 2010).
Rethinking research methodologies
Whilst there has been important ethnographically oriented work in EAP (notably Swales,
1998; also Flowerdew and Li, 2009; Johns, 1997), the overriding focus has been on texts in
EAP and on practices in Ac Lits. There is considerable convergence in recent calls for the
need for methodologies which enable holistic accounts of texts and practices (Hyland, 2014;
Lillis 2008) as well as for dialogic and collaborative methodologies (e.gJohns and Makaela,
2011; Lillis and Rai, 2011; Thesen and Cooper, 2014). The challenge of developing a
methodology which takes account of text and practice and engages at micro, meso and macro
levels of analysis is ongoing.
Rethinking writing as a networked activity
Empirical approaches to writing as social practice taken up in Ac Lits and critical EAP
problematize the predominant focus on the individual writer, foregrounding the many
participants in text production. For example, Lillis and Curry’s longitudinal study of scholars
publishing in English and other languages throws light on the key role of literacy brokers, on
writing for publication as a networked activity, and the nature of English as a networked
resource. A very different study by Tuck (2012, 2013) focuses on the role of tutors and
assessors – rather than students- in shaping undergraduate writing on its way towards the
final assessed product. Harwood et al (2012) and Turner (2011a) have foregrounded the role
of proof reading in text production. Work focusing on digital literacies highlights the need to
reconceptualise what it means to produce academic texts, challenging distinctions between
‘writing’ and ‘reading’ (e.g. Lea and Jones, 2010).
Rethinking pedagogy as transformation
Both Ac Lits and critical EAP emphasise the need for transformation in pedagogy and
orientations to language and academic production (see for example Special Issue of Journal
of English for Academic Purposes, 8 (2), 2009 and Lillis et al. eds., forthcoming) What
‘transformation’ means in specific contexts of production is necessarily a point of debate but
key principles can be summarised as follows: negotiation and dialogue should be central to the teaching learning, production and
evaluation of what counts as ‘academic’ writing
 orientations to what count as ‘appropriate’ linguistic and semiotic resources that
producers bring to meaning making in the academy need to be expanded to include
multimodality, multi and translingualism, vernacular and official practices
 in general, core conceptual categories such as ‘English’ and ‘Academic’ need to be
explored rather than taken as given, given the multiple patterns of mobility in an
increasingly transnational academia and the complex nature of recognising ‘diversity’
in academic production (Horner, forthcoming).
Rethinking ‘risk’ in the academy
Implicit in the drive to open up the academy is the need to re-think ‘risk’- most obviously
what is risked, and by whom - by questioning existing conventions. A recent collection of
papers by South African researchers tackles this challenge head-on seeking to theorise risk in
the context of postgraduate research writing. Thesen and Cooper argue against a reductive
framing of risk, exemplified by the sector’s increasing attention to plagiarism and to research
ethics approval, which they argue highlights what is acceptable rather than what is possible.
Authors offer a productive concept of risk as a “tilting point between self and other…between
the production and reception of the written word” (2014: 15), a notion explored in different
ways through a series of chapters based around empirical and pedagogic work with
postgraduate student writers.
***
Whilst we identify convergences here, we also recognise that such convergences are often not
signalled by writers, with some exceptions, including Harwood, Leung and Street, Turner,
and writers whose work focuses on writing for publication (e.g. Canagarajah, Lillis and
Curry). There is a danger that researchers/pedagogues stay separate - on the basis of whether
English is considered to be (by researchers) the first or primary language or second,
additional or foreign language – categorisations which both Ac Lits and Critical EAP
researchers have actively interrogated. In researching what it means to do academic writing
and reading in a globalised academy it will be important that researchers with shared interests
and ideological concerns engage with each other’s work, both in order to avoid workingwithin conceptual boundaries they .sseek to disrupt and as a means to develop richer
understandings of knowledge making in the contemporary world.

Pragmatist Discourse and English for
Academic Purposes
D e s m o n d A l l i s o n
Abstract--Ideological implications of pragmatic views of English language
teaching have recently been singled out as problematic (Benesch 1993; Pennycook
1994a, 1994b; Santos 1992). In particular, the teaching of English for academic
purposes (EAP) with the aim of helping people develop their academic communicative competence (Swales 1990) has been charged with reinforcing conformity
in thought and expression under the guise of pragmatic concerns. In this article,
I argue that it is misleading to represent pragmatism in EAP as a unified
discourse offering constant ideological support to an unexamined educational,
academic and sociopolitical status quo. At the same time, it is desirable to engage
constructively with critics of pragmatism in EAP and to examine concerns to
which their critiques give rise. An appeal is made for reflectively and receptively
pragmatic approaches towards the formulation and investigation of issues in
EAP and all language teaching.
Introduction
Established conceptions of language teaching as "a pragmatic business"
(Wilkins 1972: 216) have come under renewed scrutiny recently. An influential
article by Santos (1992) supports the view that second language teaching,
notably in the case of English as a second language (ESL), is characteristically
presented as a pragmatic concern, whereas L1 teaching views itself explicitly
in ideological terms. Santos observes that this difference calls for investigation
and explanation. Concentrating on the ESL aspect of Santos's distinction
between these teaching discourses, Benesch (1993) and Pennycook
(1994a,1994b) go on to present pragmatism in ESL, applied linguistics and the
teaching of English for academic purposes (EAP) as constituting a dominant
and largely unquestioned discourse or ideology in itself, a state of affairs they
see as standing in need of contestation. EAP pragmatism has been charged in
these accounts with assuming a conservative stance towards dominant
academic and sociopolitical orders. Given that EAP is usually (although not
necessarily) associated with ESL students, EAP pragmatism has been
portrayed as seeking to fit ESL students, and perhaps their teachers as well,
into approved and unquestioned subordinate roles in an educational status
quo. Varyingly described as "accommodationist" (Benesch 1993: 714) or

University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 0511, Republic of Singapore.

"assimilationist" (Pennycook 1994b: 14,16), such an ideology would seek to
change students to fit them into existing structures, thereby perpetuating
mainstream academic culture. In so doing, EAP pragmatism would deny
students and teachers their own voices within, or set against, that dominant
culture.
In reaction to these rather serious charges, I attempt here to characterise
pragmatism in EAP, and to ask what it does or fails to do. I question whether
the charges levelled against EAP pragmatism are grounded in investigation
(and refutable), rather than being based on prior stipulations. My own discussion does not presuppose that pragmatism in EAP constitutes a single coherent ideology or discourse; nor do I take for granted that a discourse or an
educational status quo seeks to maintain itself by suppressing dissenting
voices. I prefer to take such claims as matters for enquiry in particular
instances, and to consider any relationship between pragmatism and
conformism as contingent, and not essential.
One fairly obvious response to charges that pragmatist discourse in EAP, or
the ESL literature in general, fails to treat issues in ideological or political terms
"involving power relations within and outside the academy" (Benesch 1994: 624)
is to cite instances in which ESL or EAP pragmatists refer directly to ideology
(e.g., Bmmfit & Rossner 1982; Robinson 1991; Strevens 1977) or otherwise focus
on constraints on choice reflecting inequalities of power, either seeking to challenge
or undermine these constraints or pursuing desired goals in light of what remains
possible (e.g., Wilkins 1974; also edited papers in Alderson & Beretta 1992;
Johnson 1989; Quirk & Widdowson 1985). Although I maintain that such instances
abound in the literature and can be related to a wide range of educational issues
in EAP (Allison 1994a), such a strategy is not without its difficulties. Its essential
disadvantage is that it can lead to extended interpretative debate over particular
extracts that are cited and over how far such extracts are representative of
pragmatist discourse. It will therefore be helpful to introduce "pragmatic" perspecfives and goals in EAP and to discuss what counts as "pragmatist discourse".
My first step is to characterise pragmatic approaches to language teaching,
and to other areas of human activity, in terms of understanding that is related
to action in context. In this sense, pragmatic approaches take account of contextual possibilities and constraints that affect what can be achieved and at what
cost. Pragmatic approaches can be adopted in pursuit of quite diverse educational and ideological goals, some of which will promote change. One influential
and broadly conceived pragmatic goal within EAP is "to help people.., to
develop their academic communicative competence" (Swales 1990: 9). Many EAP
pragmatists probably endorse this goal or something similar to it (Santos 1992),
but critics who see EAP pragmatism as reinforcing the status quo have
challenged Swales (1990) for seeking to avoid ideology at this point. I shall-argue,
however, that these criticisms ignore Swales's stated intentions, the definitional
challenges that he was addressing, and some fundamental concerns about what
a discourse is, what it does, what it allows and what it disallows.
The issue of how a particular discourse takes up, or excludes, differences is
one that goes to the heart of accounts of discourse communities, conservationPragmatist Discourse and English for Academic Purposes 8 7
and change, and the possibility of communication. Also critical to these accounts
is the question of how "a discourse" is understood or defined. I shall outline an
alternative view of discourse, exemplified in Kress (1989), and suggest that the
priorities and assumptions of this approach can incidentally encourage the kind
of descriptive inadequacies that are apparent in some recent critical claims about
the nature of EAP pragmatist discourse. I go on to summarise a number of
instances of EAP thinking and practice in order to illustrate how pragmatic
approaches relate to academic, educational, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.
My conclusion calls for reflectively and receptively pragmatic approaches
towards the formulation and investigation of issues in EAP as in all areas of
language teaching. Throughout the discussion, I also try to take heed of what
critics of pragmatist discourse in EAP have to tell us, and to remain vigilant in
regard to all voices, including my own, as Fiumara (1990) enjoins.
Pragmatic Perspectives in EAP
The cognate words "pragmatic", "pragmatics", "pragmatism" and "pragmatist" are open to a variety of definitions and elaborations (some of book length)
according to purpose and point of view. For my current purpose, brief and fuzzy
indications of intended meaning will be appropriate, whereas comprehensive and
watertight definitions would be neither feasible nor desirable. Part of my
argument, after all, is that there is no reason to assume that "pragmatism"
constitutes a unified discourse, even when limited to the domain of EAP. I
associate "pragmafics" in linguistics with the roles of context in assigning intentions and interpretations to the utterances and texts of participants in discourse
(cf. Levinson 1983). More generally, I take "pragmatic" approaches to be sensitive to contexts of discourse and of action (van Dijk 1977). "A pragmatic
approach" towards educational issues, for instance, seeks to relate understanding to action so that each is informed by the other (Widdowson 1986, 1990). It
also aims to take full account of contextual possibilities and constraints in pursuing desired goals and in assessing the costs and benefits of proposed action {e.g.,
a particular course design or evaluation procedure) and its likely outcomes
(Johnson 1989; Wilkins 1974). At its coldest, as resources are finite, pragmatic
efficiency in EAP is concerned with "economy of time and money" (Yalden 1987:
86). "Pragmatism" in EAP refers (sometimes pejoratively, but not so in my own
usage) to "pragmatic" or "pragmatist" thinking and value judgements of this
kind that underlie context-sensitive approaches to EAP curricular issues.
This account does not represent pragmatic perspectives as oblivious to
questions of power, or otherwise as apolitical. On the contrary, I suggest that
Bismarck's famous description of politics could serve as a definition of pragmatism: the art of the possible. Johnson (1989: 18) takes the view that a coherent
language curriculum:
reconciles what is desirable (policy)with what is acceptable and possible
(pragmatic~). When the last concessionhas been squeezed from a reluctant
agencyor administration,expectationsabout what can be achievedhave to be
adjusteddownwardto what is practicable.8 8 D. Allison
Although the prospect of having to adjust expectations downwards may not
appeal, Johnson's comments are a reminder that people involved in educational
initiatives cannot and do not ignore all questions of power. Indeed, it takes
considerable skill and determination for curriculum planners to identify and
negotiate "the last concession" that a cost-conscious resourcing body would be
prepared to grant. Considerable commitment is also needed to sustain attempts
to enlist the support of senior academics and administrators for EAP initiatives,
to resist charges that EAP is really only a matter of remedial work (addressing problems that are 'all the fault of the schools'), and to establish the enhancement of students' communicative abilities as a suitable goal in an academic
curriculum. In all such cases, recognising and realising the possible is a difficult art. For this very reason, appeals to pragmatic necessity ought not to be
invoked or accepted without scrutiny. They also deserve not to be summarily
dismissed.
A Pragmatic Goal for EAP?
Without suggesting that all pragmatically minded people in EAP share a
single goal that they would formulate identically, I am ready to follow Santos
(1992) in taking comments by Swales (1990) to be broadly characteristic of
pragmatic thinking and values in EAP. Swales's declared pragmatic concern
was "to help people, both non-native and native speakers, to develop their
academic communicative competence" (Swales 1990: 9), and I believe that many
EAP pragmatists would look favourably on such an aim in the context of their
work. Swales's comments have, however, been criticised by Benesch (1993) and
Pennycook (1994a, 1 9 9 5 b ) - though not, in my interpretation, by Santos (1992)
--because they are associated with a decision not to consider "differences that
arise as a result of differing ideological perspectives" in pursuing his purposes
(Swales 1990: 9). To assess these criticisms and Swales's decision, it seems
helpful to take stock of what Swales was doing at this point in his text. The
purpose of this is not to add to earlier commentaries on Swales (1990) such as
those in Allison (1994b), Johns (1992) and Kusel (1992), but to provide a firmer
reference point for our discussion of EAP pragmatism and its critics. I cite
Swales (1990) at some length, as the passage has been selectively plundered
elsewhere in ways that lose sight of the context.
Swales (1990) introduces three key concepts, discourse community, genre, and
(language-learning) task, devoting a chapter to each. Seeking to make the discussion "(relatively) unambiguous" (1990: 9), Swales states that he does not intend
the criteria he proposes to be considered definitive, and continues (1990: 9):
Indeedratherthe opposite,for I havedeliberatelyoptedforcriteriathat are tight
and narrowand so will inevitablyexcludeparametersthat are knownto exist.
In the case of discourse community and genre, for instance, I shall not consider
differencesthat arise as a resultof differingideologicalperspectives(reference),
such as thosefoundin the workof neo-Marxistand capitalisteconomists(reference). A specificreasonfor this exclusionis that the proposedapproachis not
activatedby a wish to makea contributionto intellectualhistoryor to constructPragmatist Discourse and English for Academic Purposes 8 9
a schematic vision of disciplinary cultures, but rests on a pragmatic concern to
help people, both non-native and native speakers, to develop their academic
communicative competence. In the case of task, I have similarly opted for a
narrow definition, particularly in order to distinguish task from the looser term
activity. Narrow definitions have the advantages of being manageable and of
creating possibilities for useful dialogue. The fact that I propose, for example,
that one of the key elements requires features A, B and C, allows others to
challenge the criteria themselves, or to argue, usefully, that other definitions are
more appropriate for other circumstances.
Swales's position in this passage or brief extracts from it has been taken as
representative of pragmatism in EAP (Santos 1992). It has been depicted as
highly problematic by at least two commentators who represent pragmatism
as "an ideology (or discourse).., that infuses a great deal of applied linguistic
thinking" (Pennycook 1994a: 119). Benesch (1993) goes on to express her belief
that "the self-professed pragmatism of many EAP advocates.., actually
indicates an accommodationist ideology, an endorsement of traditional
academic teaching and of current power relations in academia and in society"
(p. 711): this ideology is one that "aims to assimilate ESL students uncritically
into academic life" (p. 714). Pennycook (1994a) represents Santos (1992) as
suggesting that a tendency to stress the pragmatic at the expense of the ideological "allows" Swales (1990) to "sweep aside the ideological implications of
discourse communities and genres" (Pennycook 1994a: 120). More generally,
Pennycook charges that "the possibilities of dealing with broader social,
cultural or political contexts of discourse are denied by appeal to an ideology
of pragmatism" (Pennycook 1994a: 120-121). Elsewhere, he makes clear that
his criticism of the ideology of pragmatism "does not just apply to genre-based
approaches" (Pennycook 1994b: 15), but implicates EAP in general.
At least two related aspects of Swales's (1990) position, and of pragmatism
in EAP, appear to have been ignored or misunderstood in these accounts. First,
Swales has not disputed that a commitment to helping people develop their
academic communicative competence is itself an ideological stance. I am
surprised that it should appear, or be represented as less than evident, that
ideology is at issue here. EAP teaching concerns clearly stand in ideological
contrast, for example, with elitist "sink or swim" traditions in which students
are simply left to come to terms for themselves with all that is involved in
academic discourse (see, e.g., Ballard & Clanchy 1991; Johns 1991; Starfield
1994; and Janopoulos 1995, for comments illustrating widespread faculty
attitudes towards ESL students and their work). EAP traditions are also clearly
opposed to the reductive view that "language teaching" is and should be limited
to "establishing the fundamental sentence patterns of the language" (see discussion in Brumfit 1985: 148). For such reasons, even "communicative language
teaching" was at one time clearly a call for change. What may have been
lacking, possibly in the absence of evident need when other kinds of explanation already have some substance (see also Santos 1992), is a sufficiently wide
and explicit acknowledgement of the role that ideology has already been
playing in such discussions in ESL and EAP.90 D. Allison
Secondly, Swales (1990) makes clear that the definitions being proposed for
"genre" and "discourse community"are those that the author believes will effectively serve his pedagogical purpose of helping people develop their academic
communicative competence. It does not really matter at this stage whether we
share Swales's (1990) view of how best to help people to develop a grasp of
how academic communication works. The point is that Swales's pragmatic
decision to exclude for this purpose "differences that arise as a result of differing ideological perspectives" (p. 9) simply does not constitute or imply any rejection or trivialisation of the importance of ideology in EAP and in second
language education, as critics have misleadingly suggested. Swales has developed an account of discourse communities and the genres they use that does
not exclude, by definition, the possibility that differing ideological perspectives
(e.g., different schools of economic theory) will sometimes compete or coexist
within the same "discourse community" (e.g., that of economists). That is a
principled choice for a stated purpose, not an airy dismissal of ideological
perspectives and differences. Swales (1990) takes the view that the definitions
and criteria he has put forward may better serve to help incoming students
(starting out as academic outsiders) to develop an understanding of what
academic communication is like and how it operates. If critics think that this
view is mistaken - - if students are not misled or confused by fundamentals of
academic communication, or if Swales's account will confuse them further
rather than giving them a point of departure, for instance then its error needs
to be shown. The superiority of some other account as a guiding flame of reference would also require comparable support that did not lose sight of the stated
purpose.
Although the shortcomings of particular criticisms may give observers
reason for caution, they do not invalidate the more general concerns about
EAP that critics are seeking to raise. The main issue that I see emerging
from current criticisms of pragmatism is whether a pragmatic view of EAP
serves to reinforce the status quo in academia and in society. Any notion
that the authority of teachers and academic institutions has gone unquestioned in EAP discourse appears naive and indefensible (compare e.g.,
Brumfit 1985; Widdowson 1986), as does Benesch's (1993) claim that EAP
pragmatists situate "authenticity" solely in academic structures (contrast
Widdowson 1979, on the authentication of language data in terms of learner
response). However, if one replaces pronouncements by questioning, we
should expect to find areas or working contexts in which academic expectations and standards remain insufficiently problematised. Paradoxically, one
such area concerns the development of students' "own" questioning and critical voices in the course of their higher education. Developing "one's own"
critical voice is a common expectation of academic staff, in certain academic
genres, and one that ESL students in particular are often perceived as failing
to satisfy (Ballard & Clanchy 1991; Johns 1991). This may partly be so
because the critical voice that students are supposed to develop is not in fact
their own (Shen 1989; Leki 1991). On the other hand, it is possible that some
groups of ESL students have never been taught the necessary writing skills,Pragmatist Discourse and English for Academic Purposes 9 1
and that ostensibly liberating approaches to writing are overlooking this
aspect of teaching, a dilemma that can also face progressive educators in
some L1 contexts (Delpit 1986). A pragmatic approach to EAP must not
ignore such questions if it is to "work" in helping students develop their
academic communicative competence. In this respect, studies of academic
writing in EAP may have been overly concerned with "nuts and bolts"
(Santos 1992: 9).
A potentially serious line of criticism of Swales's pragmatic goal for EAP
would be that conformism has been built in through the very concept of
"academic communicative competence", as Peirce (1989) has argued for communicative competence as a construct in ESL (see Harris 1995, for a similar case
within pragmatic theory). Peirce's original argument, however, hinges on a
narrow interpretation of "appropriateness" as a component of communicative
competence. Peirce takes the view that
If we teachstudents to use the Englishlanguagein a way consistentwith appropriate usage at a particulartime and place,we may run the risk of limitingour
students' perceptionsof how English can be used in society... If we teach
English in a way that promotesa student's uncritical integrationinto a society,
students will lack the tools to question the predeterminedroles established for
them by that society.(1989:407)
Although these comments omit the possibility that students may find
elsewhere or forge for themselves the tools they might need to question social
expectations and roles (see also Dubois 1990; Peirce 1990), Peirce's concerns
are legitimate and important issues for EAP. It is obviously no solution,
though, to leave students in ignorance of the likely effects of their linguistic
choices on others. Appropriateness is presented by Wilkins (1972) as a matter
of having the means to make one's own choices, not of accepting the choices
of others:
Languageis a socialactivity,and choiceof languagevaries accordingto social
function and personal intention. Language teaching must provide the learner
with means to selectlanguagewhich is suitablefor the circumstancesin which
it is used-- involvingcommandof featuresof dialect,register,mediumand style
--and which is appropriate to express his (sic) personal states and ideas
requiring mastery of a range of communicativefunctions.(1972: 159)
When appropriateness is taken to evoke a "sense of relation to contextual
features" (Hymes 1979: 23), the notion does not imply conformity to establishment views or even to communicative procedures. For example, the known
expectations of others may be deliberately flouted for communicative effect; our
understanding of this can still be accounted for in terms of a "cooperative
principle" (Grice 1975). It does not seem to be necessary to take issue with
"(academic) communicative competence" or "appropriateness" in order to raise
what are widely shared concerns over the basis of prevailing academic expectations, or the question of how students' own developing voices and academic
personalities are taken into full account in EAP.9 2 D. Allison
W h a t C o u n t s a s a D i s c o u r s e ?
So far, I have suggested that reductive accounts of EAP pragmatism as inherently conformist conspicuously fail to do justice to what prominent (pragmatic)
EAP writers have been saying and doing for more than two decades, and that
many of the concerns being raised about ESL and EAP have long formed an
important element in the deliberations of established writers in these fields.
H o w - without mirroring the same f a u l t s - might one begin to account for
these descriptive and interpretative inadequacies and also for the contentiousness of current critical commentaries on pragmatist discourse within EAP? Part
of the answer is likely to lie in different understandings of what counts as a
discourse and different approaches to discourse analysis, issues that Pennycook
(1994a) also addresses. To support my suggested explanation in this section, I
shall briefly introduce and discuss the view of discourse presented by Kress
(1989), taking this as an influential and accessible instance of recent critical
perspectives in education that draw upon the ideas of the philosopher Michel
Foucault. (There will not be space to discuss other contributions in this area,
but see especially Fairclough 1989, 1992.) Kress's book offers many insights
into text analysis, yet its treatment of discourses and social institutions remains
impressionistic and problematic. Two concerns related to our topic are: (i) how
to validate claims about what a particular discourse is like; (ii) whether, as
Kress (1989) suggests, any discourse necessarily aspires to impose a unique
theoretical and ideological viewpoint upon the social world.
Discourses, according to Kress (1989), "are systematically-organised sets of
statements which give expression to the meanings and values of an institution"
(Kress 1989: 7). (Unless otherwise specified, all page references in this section are
to Kress 1989.) They "tend towards exhaustiveness and inclusiveness" (p. 7) and
so develop an expanding and potentially comprehensive account of the social
world. This account can only be contested by other discourses, not within the
same (successfully established) discourse. A metaphor of military expansionism
recurs in the text: "A discourse colonises the social world imperialistically, from
the point of view of one institution" (p. 7); "Discourses strive towards total and
encompassing accounts in which contradictions are resolved, or at least
suppressed" (p. 11); "overlapping areas of interest.., are contested by several
discourses" (p. 11). Unresolved tensions among competing discourses are
manifested in texts. Each text "arises out of a particular problematic" (p. 12) and
becomes a site where attempts are made to resolve differences among discourses
in some way. A writer's task is "to construct a text which will most effectively
coerce the reader into accepting the constructed text" (p. 40). Consequently, "the
best reader will be a critical, a resistant reader.., who can at the same time reconstruct the text in a manner useful to herself or himself" (p. 40). Kress's account
gives considerable prominence to processes of text construction and deconstruction, to the development and expansion of discourses, and also to contestation
and tensions among discourses. It excludes, however, any notion of a discourse
as a broad debating-ground in which ideological differences within one social
institution might be acknowledged, articulated and better understood.Pragmatist Discourse and English for Academic Purposes 9,5
While recognising that a brief discussion cannot do full justice to the account
in Kress (1989), I wish to outline a number of reservations about his approach
to discourse that relate to my theme. There are problems of justification for
analyses in which the analyst claims to identify discourses at work in a text.
However revealing these analyses may be as text commentaries, their claims
about discourses cannot simply be left to speak for themselves. "A discourse"
cannot just serve as a handy label for any point of view discerned in a text
when this term has also been defined by Kress as a set of statements that are
systematically organised "from the point of view of one institution" (p. 7). The
status of institutions in Kress's account is critical. Although he emphasises that
discourse studies need to take account of discourse users' membership "in a
particular social institution, with its practices, its values, its meanings, its
demands, prohibitions, and permissions" (p. 6), Kress (1989) offers no further
definition or criteria that would enable others to identify "institutions" independently of "discourses" and so explore the relations between the two. There is
thus a serious danger that links between discourses and institutions or
discourse communities will be taken for granted, rather than being questioned
or explored.
There appear to be relatively few cases in which discourses mentioned in
Kress (1989) can readily be linked, even with goodwill, to independently recognisable social institutions such as the institution of education (p. 6) or that of
medicine (p. 20). (Contrast, for example, the unclear institutional basis of "a
moralistic/conservationist discourse", p. 10, or "romantic nineteenth-century
discourses of freedom, change and of the social.., as a species of the natural",
p. 86.) In cases where social institutions are identifiable, the stipulative nature
of Kress's account of discourses becomes more of a barrier than a source of
insight, since the account simply does not admit any possibility that one social
institution may incorporate and sustain multiple divergent points of view
within its discursive deliberations. Although Kress elsewhere introduces the
notion of "discursive multiplicity" (p. 11), this feature arises from a co-occurrence of different discourses (e.g., economic and religious discourses) within the
same social group. The possibility of radically different "schools of thought"
within one institution and its discourse remains excluded by Kress's definitions.
In a contrasting analysis of one academic discipline, Giddens (1993) represents
irreducible theoretical diversity as one of the great strengths of sociology, on
the grounds that a single theoretical and ideological perspective would not do
justice to the complexities of human social experience.
A very interesting tension that Kress (1989) makes explicit is that between
synchronic and diachronic perspectives on systems. Kress acknowledges at one
point that thinking of the social (and linguistic) system "outside time" will lend
it "the appearance of a static, fixed system" (p. 85) because a "snapshot view"
has been chosen. A "fixed system" view will obscure processes and possibilities
of change over time. Tensions between synchronic and diachronic viewpoints
will pose their own problems for accounts that define successful discourses as
comprehensive and closed systems. (The problematic nature of static accounts
is also suggested by Pennycook 1994a, but in another connection.) In an earlier9/4 D. Allison
and illuminating discussion of language as system, Hocker (1968) raises
profound questions about the relationship between conformity and change in
systems. Hockett argues that "every actual utterance.., at one and the same
time conforms to (or manifests) the system, and changes the system, however
slightly. The distinction between system-conforming and system-changing
events cannot, in principle, be made" (HockeR, 1968: 83, emphasis in original).
Extending Hockett's point, it seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that
discourse events and institutional events are likewise simultaneously implicated
in conformity and change.
Some immediate implications for accounts of EAP pragmatist discourse can
now be drawn. The insightful text commentaries in Kress (1989) encourage us
to repudiate any simplistic assignment of one text to membership of a single
discourse. It follows that apparent inconsistencies between a claim that EAP
pragmatism is conformist and other observations made about an associated text
(e.g., that its writer challenges the status quo) will not necessarily be accepted
as evidence against the claim, on the grounds that other discourses may also
be at work in that text. (When, in short, is the pragmatist being pragmatic?)
Any attempt to assess claims about EAP pragmatist discourse by referring to
EAP texts must consequently remain open to interpretation and evaluation of
evidence that it brings forward. This is not to say, however, that apparent
counter-evidence can simply be set aside as necessarily arising from some other
discourse in a text. Such a priori thinking would make it dangerously easy for
commentators to stipulate that EAP pragmatism is a conformist discourse while
appearing to claim that this is so. An alternative and less pre-emptive view of
these issues is to recognise that commentaries and asides on the nature of EAP
pragmatism also need to be critically assessed. I would continue to argue that
reference to pragmatist writings, talk, practice and value judgements throughout professional life in EAP is an important element in such assessment.
In the following section, I shall attempt to illustrate EAP pragmatist
discourse by reviewing instances of professional discussion in the EAP literature. To save space, I shall not discuss how far and in what sense EAP may
count as a profession, but refer interested readers to comments by Maley (1992)
on English language teaching as a whole.
EAP Pragmatism at Work
This section will briefly review a number of experiences reported in the EAP
literature and relate them to ideological questions and values within published
discourse in EAP. "EAP pragmatism" is taken to cover the thinking and value
judgements that underlie context-sensitive approaches to EAP curricular issues
and that pursue the art of the possible within these contexts of understanding,
action and evaluation. EAP pragmatism can be observed at work across a range
of geographical, educational and cultural settings. My focus will be on undergraduate teaching. (I would anticipate that charges that EAP work seeks to fit
students uncritically into a status quo will not be better founded or even more
plausible when work with mature postgraduates is considered.) The fivePragmatist Discourseand English for AcademicPurposes 95
examples below illustrate varying degrees of curricular innovation, and of
modification and challenge to prevailing practices, in the light of what has
appeared possible and important to people working in different situations.
Love (1991) found that geology students and faculty at the University of
Zimbabwe reported themselves as dissatisfied with the students' abilities to
cope with tertiary textbooks. Love points out that the textbooks in question
had not been written with an ESL readership or a local context in mind. She
identified the main obstacle for students as a lack of appropriate content
schemata to help them interpret geology texts, rather than an unfamiliarity
with formal schemata for textbook organisation. Love then set out to characterise, for EAP teaching, the content schemata that might assist these
students. (Love herself refers to "ESP" or "specific" purpose teaching.) She
undertook a detailed study of the (British) textbook in current use on the
geology course and the (American) textbook that was being considered as a
possible replacement. These books were evidently the only current options in
the context.
Love found considerable differences in the ways in which the authors set out
to introduce an acculturate students to the subject. Despite these differences,
Love concluded that awareness of geological processes and their products could
offer a valuable frame of reference for readers of either textbook, and in principle (subject to further research) in work with other geology texts as well. Love
expresses the hope that more research of this kind can "provide the ESP teacher
with tools for assisting students to acquire literacy in their specific areas of
study" (p. 102).
Although many EAP teachers and researchers will recognise the kind of
circumstances in which Love was working, some features are worth specifying
here. The choice of textbooks for the subject course appears to have been
limited both by resources and by the fact that locally situated texts in the
subject did not yet exist. While it would have been interesting to know more
about the ways in which the curriculum was locally contextualised by its teachers, it is clear that the situation was recognised as less than ideal (the textbook
choice being in fact under review). Immediate possibilities for change, though,
were probably quite restricted. The case for working with a single core textbook
is not discussed by Love (1991), but textbooks are quite commonly assumed to
provide students with guidance and support. A condition, obviously, is that
students can understand and work with the text, which is precisely the concern
that Love's intervention seeks to address. Although Love's declared goal of
"assisting students to acquire literacy in their specific areas of study" might be
interpreted by some critics as inherently accommodationist, I would suggest
that we would need to know far more about pedagogic aims and strategies
(which are not the focus of Love's article) before any such judgement could
reasonably be either warranted or refuted. A more positively speculative interpretation of such goals in EAP, however, would place them firmly within an
ESL teaching tradition, going back at least to Palmer (1921), which is concerned
to eliminate bewilderment among students so that learning in any form is better
able to take place.9 6 D. Allison
Flowerdew (1993) reports that extreme reading difficulties were identified
among science students at Sultan Qaboos University, ()man, relative to
prescribed course materials. After consultation with science faculty members,
EAP staff eventually produced simplified versions of the core reading material
so that students' comprehension opportunities were enhanced and so that their
abilities could continue to develop. These materials became the required reading
in support of the content lectures, thereby involving changes in educational
practice that were wider than the EAP class itself. Any attempt to simplify
teaching materials or tasks is, as Flowerdew's comments suggest, a strategy
that requires careful evaluative scrutiny both to ensure short-term effectiveness
and to assess long-term value in developing students' communicative and critical abilities. Flowerdew in fact identifies a vicious circle (a "Catch-22" situation)
with regard to students' writing, in which "scientists did not require writing
because students were unable to supply it and English teachers did not teach
writing because scientists did not require it from their students" (p. 131). The
damage only became apparent in later years when scientists started to demand
sophisticated writing from students who lacked the necessary training and
experience to produce it. Language and content staff went on to create a set of
short-answer writing tasks of appropriate difficulty level and content relevance.
This work initiated significant changes in curricular practice to prepare
students for a more advanced and autonomous role in later work.
Johns (1993) identifies another mismatch between restricted short-term needs
for undergraduate writing and substantially greater demands for subsequent
writing in the case of ESL students planning to major in engineering in a
university in the U.S.A. From interviews with engineering faculty and administrators, Johns established the centrality of grant writing as a professional
genre. She then conducted extensive interviews with two successful grant
writers. Very careful planning for a specific and powerful readership (individually targeted peer reviewers) was identified as an important lever for success
in grant writing. Johns concludes that a clear pedagogic focus should be given
to certain attributes of successful grant writing that had proved relevant to peer
reviewers, in particular to establishing the currency, precision and scope of
claim statements made in proposals. She then exemplifies work at undergraduate level that can provide students with the experience of writing on issues
of moment for them to real and powerful readers whose expectations need to
be discovered and taken into account. Johns describes one instance in which
students wrote to university trustees and state legislators to protest over a 40%
increase in fees. This particular example might elicit many questions, from a
variety of ideological perspectives. (Who initiated the work? Was the teacher
seen as fomenting disaffection, or as diverting protest into innocuous channels?
What response, if any, was elicited from target readers? How did students feel?)
Readers may want to know more, and space is always a problem; nonetheless,
Johns (1993) has demonstrably described EAP work that does not ignore or
deny wider realities of power.
A parameter that may affect both task authenticity and the quality of student
involvement is the extent to which materials and tasks take account of students'Pragmatist Discourseand English for AcademicPurposes 97
existing knowledge and culture. Barron (1991)and colleagues at the Papua New
Guinea (PNG) University of Technology developed a project in Traditional
Engineering that was designed to help students and educators recognise the
place of engineering principles and practices within (very diverse) PNG traditional cultures. Barron reports that engineering staff who participated in the
project acknowledged that they had gained a greater interest in and understanding of their students' backgrounds and the potential relevance of traditional practices for their engineering courses. Barron comments on the
importance of viewing ESP (including EAP) as a part of education in its own
right. The article is an excellent example of understanding related to action in
context that has been realised in a collaborative educational initiative leading
to substantial curricular and attitudinal changes. Barron's work is situated
within ESP traditions (e.g., it explicitly pursues links with cultural anthropology suggested by Swales (1985a), and it also extends these traditions rather
than perpetuating old beliefs and practices uncritically.
Starfield (1994) reports on EAP experiences at the University of the
Witwatersrand (WITS) in South Africa. She points out that incoming black
students were not in the fortunate position envisaged by Widdowson (1978) in
which EAP students seek to transfer existing academic literacy into English,
but that they had yet to acquire academic language proficiency, especially in
the context-reduced modes of academic writing, since this has been lacking in
their schooling. She warns that mainstream faculty perceptions of these
students as experiencing linguistic and cognitive difficulties may only be
reinforced by a "traditional" EAP programme (presumably meaning EAP
classes that are separate from the rest of the curriculum). The EAP teachers
at WITS have consequently collaborated with faculty in order to develop an
adjunct model that can more adequately contextualise their work by relating
it directly to students' subject curricula. Starfield indicates that this initiative
is moving towards a situation in which their Academic Support Programme
can start to raise more fundamental curricular issues with the mainstream
faculty.
EAP Pragmatism in Perspective
Like many reports in the EAP literature, these five highly summarised
accounts of EAP practice and thinking have included varying degrees of negotiation and cooperation between EAP teachers and faculty, and have described
initiatives that were designed to contextualise EAP learning experiences more
effectively within the content of academic curricula. Although it is tempting to
develop the theme of EAP teachers as pragmatic agents of change, that would
itself be a contestable and dubious generalisation. ("Change agent" accounts of
EAP are unfortunately also liable to create "mainstream" stereotypes of their
own when summarising the educational perspectives of other subject teachers.)
My position remains, rather, that general categorisations of EAP pragmatist
discourse and practice, whether these are presented as conformist, reformist, or
quietly revolutionary, will be less insightful, and more misleading, than a9 8 D. Allison
(pragmatic) willingness to recognise and investigate the diverse goals, strategies, tactics and contexts that actual EAP experience subsumes. Helping
students to succeed in these various settings is itself a significant educational
commitment. In pursuing or evaluating this commitment in particular instances,
it is clearly important to verify that students' needs, difficulties and learning
opportunities have been convincingly identified, and not just conveniently
presupposed, as a reason for teaching. There is, I submit, ample evidence of
this concern in the EAP research literature.
A remaining criticism that might be levelled at many accounts of EAP initiatives is that they operate within, and so presuppose, current educational
systems and social contexts. Although wider sociopolitical factors have not
been altogether ignored in the above work, it is true that most EAP articles
present or presuppose a context and do not set out to review an entire system,
the interests it serves and the people it fails or excludes. This is not, in itself,
a legitimate reason to criticise EAP work, which has concerns and aims of its
own. For many purposes, it is far from obvious, and would instead need to be
shown, how broad sociopolitical perspectives may usefully illuminate the
specifics of teaching and learning that are likely to concern many EAP teachers and researchers. Thus, for example, the colonial history of a state is
certainly likely to influence the extent and nature of learners' motivation or
disinclination to learn English, as Wilkins (1974) already points out, but this
observation does not begin to explain the specifics of what is learnt well or
what proves unusually resistant to learning. Research that actually links broad
perspectives to such specifics would be invaluable.
The preceding comments must not in any way be taken to repudiate the value
of other wider discussion of educational practice of the kind that was exemplified
some years ago in the ESL literature by Rogers (1982). Rogers' rifle, "The world
for sick proper" would probably elude a keyword search for ideology in ESL
(Santos 1992, followed this procedure). The title carries the comment of a nineyear-old Ghanaian boy on the sorry state of a world that offers few and harsh
opportunities to primary school dropouts with a smattering of English. The impact
of English-medium (and other) educational systems on people designated as
failures is a major cost to be weighed, and not ignored, when educational planners
and communities assess the effectiveness, and the humanity, of entire educational
systems. Alternative policies, such as universal mother-tongue education, will also
carry financial, educational, social and political costs that need to be counted in
particular contexts. Discussions of broad educational planning issues that take
serious account of contextual possibilities and constraints, as Sridhar (1994) does
for mother-tongue education, can offer valuable pragmatic contributions to professional and communal deliberations and actions. Such work clearly has its place
in the EAP literature, and more examples would be welcome.
Concluding Remarks
In the course of this article, I have challenged the validity of accounts that
portray EAP pragmatism as a unified ideology offering support to the statusPragmatist Discourse and English for Academic Purposes 9 9
quo of existing power relations in education and society. I have suggested
instead that pragmatically inclined EAP practitioners and scholars seek to
contextualise their understanding and action, in a wide variety of circumstances, in order to pursue educational goals that they value within possibilities and constraints that they identify. Some pragmatic initiatives bring about
substantial changes in curricular practice and relations. Others seek to enhance
educational experiences and opportunities through more subtle adjustments to
practice. Evaluating these contributions is not a simple task. I have also
suggested that 'the status quo' is itself a problematic notion. Existing practice
is unlikely to be constant, uniform and fixed; the roles and relations of teachers and learners reflect changes as well as continuities in expectations. This
raises interesting problems over what commentators choose to present as
conformism, or as contestation, within EAP and in other educational fields. Two
aspects to this issue are the limitations of a synchronic account, as suggested
above, and the generic conventions of academic discourse.
Following Hockett (1968), it is possible to interpret the ostensibly opposed
notions of conservation and innovation, and those of system-conforming and
system-changing moves, as complementary perspectives upon the same set of
events and relations. A synchronic or 'snapshot' analysis will present a static
account, but only as a descriptive convenience that ignores changes as events
unfold over time. (As Hockett notes, in a picture of a horse race, the horses are
not actually moving.) To observe that change is in fact ubiquitous is not, of
course, to imply that 'the status quo' is a meaningless notion, but to point out
that it is in danger of remaining an unanalysed one when generalised claims
are put forward about supposed mainstream values and practices. Analysis of
conservative or radical tendencies within EAP will need to be specific about
what is changed, contested or maintained, and why, when a relationship
between EAP practice and a status quo is proposed in particular settings. It is
usually salutary to ask whether an EAP initiative is serving other powerful
interests, perhaps as an instance of the "dynamic conservatism" identified by
Everard and Morris (1990; cited in Rea-Dickens & Germaine 1992: 221) in which
some changes are encouraged so that other less welcome ones can be more
effectively obstructed. It cannot, however, be helpful to presuppose that this is
the case, or that EAP practitioners are unaware of such possibilities, or indeed
that any alliance of interests is automatically pernicious.
A further difficulty in evaluating discussions of the ways in which EAP work
may contribute to conservation or change lies in the nature of academic discourse
conventions. Widely cited work by Swales (1985b, 1990) and Myers (1989), among
other contributions, points towards a complex set of relations between signals of
continuity and of disjuncture when academic writers move to create a research
space, or to establish new knowledge claims, against the background of earlier
work in their discourse communities. Viewed in this light, a mainstream tradition may merely be serving as a handy rhetorical device, whether the tradition
is apparently being followed, extended or attacked at a given point.
For many reasons, then, the identification and evaluation of conformist and
dissenting tendencies within a professional discourse remains a complex1O0 D. Allison
exercise, in which careful account has to be taken of the ambivalence, complementarity and interdependence of apparent continuities and contrasts. In recognition of this need, although I have made my share of pronouncements, I have
tried in this article to encourage reflective and receptive attitudes rather than
purely adversarial ones towards differences of viewpoint and value among
language educators. A willingness to listen has elsewhere been advocated as
supporting "the patient labours of coexistence" (Fiumara 1990: 40) that help to
sustain community and diversity alike. In this spirit, I am confident that
resolutely pragmatic approaches towards academic enquiry will continue to
assist teachers and researchers of many ideological persuasions to contextualise
and investigate the questions of purpose and value that matter to them,
throughout and beyond the domain of EAP teaching and learning.
Acknowledgements - - I am grateful to Liz Hamp-Lyons (Editor) and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive criticisms and valuable detailed suggestions on the original draft. The revised article owes them a great deal. I also
thank former students and colleagues at the English Centre, The University of
Hong Kong, who provided the human context that first prompted and encouraged this discussion. I am of course responsible for the content and its shortcomings.
